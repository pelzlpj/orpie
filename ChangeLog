Orpie ChangeLog
------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.5

   2007-09-17        ln() and log10() now return complex values for
                     negative real arguments.

   2007-09-13        Version 1.5.1 release.
   
                     pow() now avoids using complex arithmetic in
                     some cases, leading to more pleasant results
                     for expressions like 2^3 - 7.
                     
                     Fixed "invalid argument" crash bug when typing
                     an unprintable character during entry of units.
                     
                     Made a minor syntactical change for compatibility
                     with OCaml 3.10.0.

   2007-09-13        Version 1.5.0 release.

   2007-07-01        Complete rewrite of units implementation, allowing
                     user-defined units and physical constants.

   2007-05-06        Updated included ocamlgsl bindings to 0.6.0.

   2006-11-13        Square root of a negative value now returns a
                     complex result.

   2006-11-12        gcd(), lcd(), and mod() now accept real-valued 
                     arguments.
   
                     Fix for crash in abbrev mode.

   2004-09-09        Made a minor Makefile change to correct linking
                     errors under Gentoo (maybe others).

                     Numerous code cleanups.  Calculator code has
                     been better separated from interface code.

   2004-09-07        Support --sysconfdir configure option.  (Anyone
                     packaging for the filesystem hierarchy standard
                     will now need to use something like "./configure
                     --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc".)

   2004-09-03        Implemented entry of most fundamental physical 
                     constants.

   2004-08-31        Fixed incorrect error message regarding deprecated
                     extended_enter command.

v1.4

   2005-10-29        Version 1.4.3 release.

                     Backported a bugfix for crash when executing
                     uconvert() with only one element on the stack.

   2005-09-21        Version 1.4.2 release.

   2005-09-20        Updated build script for better support on
                     FreeBSD and OS X.

   2004-09-17        Version 1.4.1 release.

   2004-09-15        Updated the build dependency tree, so parallel
                     make should work properly again.

   2004-09-09        Made a minor Makefile change to correct linking
                     errors under Gentoo (maybe others).

   2004-09-01        Made some minor documentation fixes.

   2004-08-31        Fixed incorrect error message regarding deprecated
                     extended_enter command.

   2004-08-30        Version 1.4.0 release.
   
                     Started work on a testing framework for the
                     rpc_calc object.  (I'd really appreciate help
                     writing test cases--see calc_test.ml .)
   
                     Implemented matrix trace.

   2004-08-29        Integrated unit handling code.  Real and complex 
                     scalars and matrices can are now dimensioned
                     quantities.  Unit conversion and base
                     standardization operators were added.

                     When entering external data, the integer base 
                     separator character was changed from '_' to '`'.

   2004-08-27        Raising a negative real number to a noninteger
                     power now produces a complex value rather than
                     real-valued 'nan'.

   2004-08-23        Deprecated "extended_" operation identifiers in
                     favor of somewhat more clear "abbrev_" 
                     identifiers.

                     Added methods to include (i.e. source) rcfiles
                     within each other, remove key bindings, and remove
                     operation abbreviations.

   2004-07-19        Implemented automatic key bindings.

                     Deprecated operation "function_rand" in favor of
                     "command_rand" because it does not take an 
                     argument.


v1.3

   2004-07-22        Version 1.3.1 release.
   
                     Ocaml 3.08 support: an include string is provided
                     to the compiler when building curses bindings.

                     Added a fix for a possible crash when drawing
                     help panel and using a custom minimalist
                     orpierc.

   2004-07-18        User variables are now evaluated before being
                     passed as arguments to var().

   2004-07-17        Version 1.3.0 release.

                     Added permutation function and random number
                     generator.

                     Implemented common single-variable statistics
                     functions, and an upper tail normal probability
                     function.

   2004-07-16        Included "register" variable shortcut macros in
                     orpierc.
                     
                     Added a configuration option to conserve memory
                     by turning off string caching.

                     Added a background thread that precomputes
                     string representations of stack elements.

   2004-07-13        Implemented memoization of string representations
                     for stack elements.

   2004-07-08        Replaced general integer base conversion algorithm 
                     with fast (N*log(N) or better) divide-and-
                     -conquer algorithms.

   2004-07-04        Added binomial coefficient function.

   2004-07-03        Added LCM function.

   2004-06-27        Implemented a method for handling interruptible
                     computations.

                     Added exact factorial and GCD functions.


v1.2

   2004-06-16        Version 1.2.0 release.

   2004-06-15        Fixed the build script to support parallel make.
   
                     Replaced 'datafile', 'buffer', and 'input_buffer'
                     orpierc variables with the 'datadir' variable.
                     
                     Fixed crash due to displaying 'about' screen in
                     a very small terminal window.

   2004-06-14        Implemented user-defined variables and
                     autocompletion routines.

   2004-06-13        mod() now has a check for >1 stack elements.

   2004-04-22        Orpie no longer generates an error message if
                     it is run without a preexisting calculator
                     state file.


v1.1

   2004-04-17        Version 1.1.1 release.  Added Chris Petersen's
                     orpie.spec file for building RPMs.

   2004-04-16        Version 1.1 release.

   2004-04-14        Added a linear system solver that avoids
                     computation of an inverse matrix.

   2004-04-13        Created a parser and associated routines that
                     enable Orpie to read data entered in an external
                     editor.

   2004-04-10        Added a check for inversion of ill-conditioned
                     real matrices.

                     Implemented Mutt-like rcfile macros.

   2004-04-09        Added a configuration variable to enable
                     hiding the help panel.


v1.0

   2004-04-07        Version 1.0.2 release.  Added a manpage for

   2004-04-05        Version 1.0.1 release.  Minor changes to the build
                     script, to assist in package creation (thanks to
                     Uwe Steinmann for the patch).

   2004-04-01        Version 1.0 release.

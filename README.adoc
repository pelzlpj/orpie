Orpie README
============

Orpie is a Curses-based RPN calculator.

== Installation
=== Using OPAM
The recommended method for installing Orpie is to use
https://opam.ocaml.org/[OPAM].  +opam install orpie+ should get the job done. You need to install +gsl+ and +pkg-config+ first.

=== Without using OPAM
If you want to install manually, you will need the following OCaml packages installed:

* OCaml 4.03+
* dune
* camlp5
* ocamlfind
* curses (registered with ocamlfind)
* gsl (registered with ocamlfind)

If you have satisfied all the dependencies, then use the Makefile to build:

----
# optionally set an installation prefix (default is /usr/local)
$ export PREFIX=/usr

# optionally set a staging directory (useful if you're creating a package)
$ export DESTDIR=/tmp/orpie

# build
$ make

# install build products (use 'sudo' if installing to a root-owned location)
$ make install
----

== Usage
See the 'doc' subdirectory for more extensive documentation.

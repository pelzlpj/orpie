.SH NAME

orpierc is the configuration textfile for the \fIorpie\fP(1)
console calculator. 
.PP
.SH INTRODUCTION

CAUTION: while this manpage should be suitable as a quick reference, it may 
be subject to miscellaneous shortcomings in typesetting. The definitive 
documentation is the user manual provided with Orpie in PDF format. 
.PP
Orpie reads a run\-configuration textfile (generally /etc/orpierc or 
/usr/local/etc/orpierc) to determine key and command bindings. You can 
create a personalized configuration file in $HOME/.orpierc, and select 
bindings that match your usage patterns. The recommended procedure is to ``include\&'' 
the orpierc file provided with Orpie 
(see INCLUDING OTHER RCFILES), 
and add or remove settings as desired. 
.PP
.SH ORPIERC SYNTAX

You may notice that the orpierc syntax is similar to the syntax used in 
the configuration file for the Mutt email client (muttrc). 
.PP
Within the orpierc file, strings should be enclosed in double quotes ("). 
A double quote character inside a string may be represented by 
\\" \&. 
The backslash character must be represented by doubling it 
(\\\\).
.PP
.SS INCLUDING OTHER RCFILES
Syntax: include \fIfilename_string\fP
.br
.br
This syntax can be used to include one run\-configuration file within another. 
This command could be used to load the default orpierc file (probably 
found in /etc/orpierc) within your personalized rcfile, 
 {/.orpierc}. The filename string should be enclosed in quotes. 
.PP
.SS SETTING CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
Syntax: set \fIvariable\fP=\fIvalue_string\fP
.br
.br
Several configuration variables can be set using this syntax; check 
the CONFIGURATION VARIABLES description 
to see a list. The variables are unquoted, but the values should be quoted strings. 
.PP
.SS CREATING KEY BINDINGS
Syntax: bind \fIkey_identifier operation\fP
.br
.br
This command will bind a keypress to execute a calculator operation. 
The various operations, which should not be enclosed in quotes, 
may be found in 
the section on CALCULATOR OPERATIONS. 
Key identifiers may be specified by strings that represent a single keypress, 
for example "m" (quotes included). The key may be prefixed with 
"\\\\C" or "\\\\M" 
to represent Control or Meta (Alt) modifiers, respectively; note that the 
backslash must be doubled. A number of special keys lack single\-character 
representations, so the following strings may be used to represent them: 
.TP
.B *
"<esc>" 
.TP
.B *
"<tab>" 
.TP
.B *
"<enter>" 
.TP
.B *
"<return>" 
.TP
.B *
"<insert>" 
.TP
.B *
"<home>" 
.TP
.B *
"<end>" 
.TP
.B *
"<pageup>" 
.TP
.B *
"<pagedown>" 
.TP
.B *
"<space>" 
.TP
.B *
"<left>" 
.TP
.B *
"<right>" 
.TP
.B *
"<up>" 
.TP
.B *
"<down>" 
.TP
.B *
"<f1>" to "<f12>" 
.PP
Due to differences between various terminal emulators, this key identifier syntax may 
not be adequate to describe every keypress. As a workaround, Orpie will also accept key 
identifiers in octal notation. As an example, you could use 
\\024 
(do \fInot\fP
enclose it in quotes) to represent Ctrl\-T. 
.PP
Orpie includes a secondary executable, orpie\-curses\-keys, that prints out 
the key identifiers associated with keypresses. You may find it useful when customizing 
orpierc. 
.PP
Multiple keys may be bound to the same operation, if desired. 
.PP
.SS REMOVING KEY BINDINGS
Syntax: 
.br
unbind_function \fIkey_identifier\fP
.br
unbind_command \fIkey_identifier\fP
.br
unbind_edit \fIkey_identifier\fP
.br
unbind_browse \fIkey_identifier\fP
.br
unbind_abbrev \fIkey_identifier\fP
.br
unbind_variable \fIkey_identifier\fP
.br
unbind_integer \fIkey_identifier\fP
.br
.br
These commands will remove key bindings associated with the various entry 
modes (functions, commands, editing operations, etc.). The key identifiers 
should be defined using the syntax described in the previous section. 
.PP
.SS CREATING KEY AUTO\-BINDINGS
Syntax: autobind \fIkey_identifier\fP
.br
.br
In order to make repetitive calculations more pleasant, Orpie offers an automatic key 
binding feature. When a function or command is executed using its abbreviation, 
one of the keys selected by the autobind syntax will be 
automatically bound to that operation (unless the operation has already been bound 
to a key). The current set of autobindings can be viewed in the help panel by executing 
command_cycle_help (bound to \&'h\&' by default). 
.PP
The syntax for the key identifiers is provided in the previous section. 
.PP
.SS CREATING OPERATION ABBREVIATIONS
Syntax: abbrev \fIoperation_abbreviation operation\fP
.br
.br
You can use this syntax to set the abbreviations used within Orpie to represent the 
various functions and commands. A list of available operations may be found in 
the CALCULATOR OPERATIONS section. 
The operation abbreviations should be quoted strings, for example "sin" 
or "log". 
.PP
Orpie performs autocompletion on these abbreviations, allowing you to type 
usually just a few letters in order to select the desired command. The order of the 
autocompletion matches will be the same as the order in which the abbreviations are 
registered by the rcfile\-\-so you may wish to place the more commonly used operation 
abbreviations earlier in the list. 
.PP
Multiple abbreviations may be bound to the same operation, if desired. 
.PP
.SS REMOVING OPERATION ABBREVIATIONS
Syntax: unabbrev \fIoperation_abbreviation\fP
.br
.br
This syntax can be used to remove an operation abbreviation. The operation abbreviations 
should be quoted strings, as described in the previous section. 
.PP
.SS CREATING MACROS
Syntax: macro \fIkey_identifier macro_string\fP
.br
.br
You can use this syntax to cause a single keypress (the \fIkey_identifier\fP)
to be interpreted as the series of keypresses listed in \fImacro_string\fP\&.
The syntax for defining a keypress is the same as that defined in 
the section on CREATING KEY BINDINGS. 
The macro string should be a list of whitespace\-separated keypresses, e.g. 
"2 <return> 2 +" (including quotes). 
.PP
This macro syntax provides a way to create small programs; by way of example, 
the default orpierc file includes macros for the base 2 logarithm and the 
binary entropy function (bound to L and H, respectively), 
as well as ``register\&'' variable shortcuts (<f1> to <f12>). 
.PP
Macros may call other macros recursively. However, take care that a macro does 
not call \fIitself\fP
recursively; Orpie will not trap the infinite loop. 
.PP
Note that operation abbreviations may be accessed within macros. For example, 
macro "A" "\&' a b o u t <return>" would bind A to display 
the ``about Orpie\&'' screen. 
.PP
.SS CREATING UNITS
Syntax: 
.br
base_unit \fIunit_symbol preferred_prefix\fP
.br
unit \fIunit_symbol unit_definition\fP
.br
.br
Units are defined in a two\-step process: 
.TP
1.
Define a set of orthogonal ``base units.\&'' All other units must be expressible 
in terms of these base units. The base units can be given a preferred SI prefix, 
which will be used whenever the units are standardized (e.g. via ustand). 
The unit symbols and preferred prefixes should all be quoted strings; to prefer 
\fIno\fP
prefix, use the empty string (""). 
.PP
It is expected that most users will use the fundamental SI units for base units. 
.TP
2.
Define all other units in terms of either base units or previously\-defined units. 
Again, the unit symbol and unit definition should be quoted strings. The definition 
should take the form of a numeric value followed by a units string, e.g. 
"2.5_kN*m/s". See 
the UNITS FORMATTING section 
for more details on the unit string format. 
.PP
.SS CREATING CONSTANTS
Syntax: constant \fIconstant_symbol constant_definition\fP
.br
.br
This syntax can be used to define a physical constant. Both the constant symbol 
and definition must be quoted strings. The constant definition should be a 
numeric constant followed by a units string e.g. "1.60217733e\-19_C". 
All units used in the constant definition must already have been defined. 
.PP
.SH CONFIGURATION VARIABLES

The following configuration variables may be set as described in the SETTING 
CONFIGURATION VARIABLES section. 
.TP
.B *
datadir 
.br 
This variable should be set to the full path of the Orpie data directory, 
which will contain the calculator state save file, temporary buffers, etc. 
The default directory is 
"\\~/.orpie/". 
.TP
.B *
editor 
.br 
This variable may be set to the fullscreen editor of your choice. The default 
value is "vi". It is recommended that you choose an editor that offers 
horizontal scrolling in place of word wrapping, so that the columns of large 
matrices can be properly aligned. (The Vim editor could be used in this fashion 
by setting editor to "vim \-c \&'set nowrap\&'".) 
.TP
.B *
hide_help 
.br 
Set this variable to "true" to hide the left help/status panel, or leave 
it on the default of "false" to display the help panel. 
.TP
.B *
conserve_memory 
.br 
Set this variable to "true" to minimize memory usage, or leave it on 
the default of "false" to improve rendering performance. (By default, 
Orpie caches multiple string representations of all stack elements. Very large 
integers in particular require significant computation for string representation, 
so caching these strings can make display updates much faster.) 
.PP
.SH CALCULATOR OPERATIONS

Every calculator operation can be made available to the interface using the syntax 
described in 
the sections on CREATING KEY BINDINGS and CREATING OPERATION ABBREVIATIONS. 
The following is a list of every available operation. 
.PP
.SS FUNCTIONS
The following operations are functions\-\-that is, they will consume at least one 
argument from the stack. Orpie will generally abort the computation and 
provide an informative error message if a function cannot be successfully applied (for 
example, if you try to compute the transpose of something that is not a matrix). 
.PP
For the exact integer data type, basic arithmetic operations will yield an exact 
integer result. Division of two exact integers will yield the quotient of 
the division. The more complicated functions will generally promote the integer 
to a real number, and as such the arithmetic will no longer be exact. 
.TP
.B *
function_10_x 
.br 
Raise 10 to the power of the last stack element (inverse of function_log10). 
.TP
.B *
function_abs 
.br 
Compute the absolute value of the last stack element. 
.TP
.B *
function_acos 
.br 
Compute the inverse cosine of the last stack element. For real numbers, 
The result will be provided either in degrees or radians, depending on 
the angle mode of the calculator. 
.TP
.B *
function_acosh 
.br 
Compute the inverse hyperbolic cosine of the last stack element. 
.TP
.B *
function_add 
.br 
Add last two stack elements. 
.TP
.B *
function_arg 
.br 
Compute the argument (phase angle of complex number) of the last stack 
element. The value will be provided in either degrees or radians, 
depending on the current angle mode of the calculator. 
.TP
.B *
function_asin 
.br 
Compute the inverse sine of the last stack element. For real numbers, 
The result will be provided either in degrees or radians, depending on 
the angle mode of the calculator. 
.TP
.B *
function_asinh 
.br 
Compute the inverse hyperbolic sine of the last stack element. 
.TP
.B *
function_atan 
.br 
Compute the inverse tangent of the last stack element. For real numbers, 
The result will be provided either in degrees or radians, depending on 
the angle mode of the calculator. 
.TP
.B *
function_atanh 
.br 
Compute the inverse hyperbolic tangent of the last stack element. 
.TP
.B *
function_binomial_coeff 
.br 
Compute the binomial coefficient (``n choose k\&'') formed by the last two 
stack elements. If these arguments are real, the coefficient is computed 
using a fast approximation to the log of the gamma function, and therefore 
the result is subject to rounding errors. For exact integer arguments, 
the coefficient is computed using exact arithmetic; this has the potential 
to be a slow operation. 
.TP
.B *
function_ceiling 
.br 
Compute the ceiling of the last stack element. 
.TP
.B *
function_convert_units 
.br 
Convert stack element 2 to an equivalent expression in the units of 
element 1. Element 1 should be real\-valued, and its magnitude will 
be ignored when computing the conversion. 
.TP
.B *
function_cos 
.br 
Compute the cosine of the last stack element. If the argument is real, 
it will be assumed to be either degrees or radians, depending on the 
angle mode of the calculator. 
.TP

Compute the hyperbolic cosine of the last stack element. 
.TP
.B *
function_conj 
.br 
Compute the complex conjugate of the last stack element. 
.TP
.B *

Divide element 2 by element 1. 
.TP
.B *
function_erf 
.br 
Compute the error function of the last stack element.

.TP
.B *
function_exp 
.br 
Evaluate the exponential function of the last stack element. 
.TP
.B *
function_factorial 
.br 
Compute the factorial of the last stack element. For a real argument, 
this is computed using a fast approximation to the gamma function, 
and therefore the result may be subject to rounding errors (or overflow). For an 
exact integer argument, the factorial is computed using exact arithmetic; 
this has the potential to be a slow operation. 
.TP
.B *
function_floor 
.br 
Compute the floor of the last stack element. 
.TP
.B *
function_gamma 
.br 
Compute the Euler gamma function of the last stack element.

returning a 1xM matrix as a result. 
.TP
.B *
function_minimum 
.br

Compute the sample means of each of the columns of a real NxM matrix, 
returning a 1xM matrix as a result. 
.TP

to integer type data. 
.TP
.B *
function_mult 
.br 
Multiply last two stack elements.

function_permutation 
.br 
Compute the permutation coefficient determined by the last two stack 
elements \&'n\&' and \&'k\&': the number of ways of obtaining an ordered subset 
of k elements from a set of n elements. 
If these arguments are real, the coefficient is computed 
using a fast approximation to the log of the gamma function, and therefore 
the result is subject to rounding errors. For exact integer arguments, 
the coefficient is computed using exact arithmetic; this has the potential 
to be a slow operation. 
.TP

Raise element 2 to the power of element 1. 
.TP
.B *
function_purge

function_re 
.br 
Compute the real part of the last stack element. 
.TP
.B *
function_sin 
.br 
Compute the sine of the last stack element. If the argument is real, it 
will be assumed to be either degrees or radians, depending on the angle 
mode of the calculator. 
.TP
.B *
function_sinh 
.br 
Compute the hyperbolic sine of the last stack element. 
.TP
.B *
function_solve_linear 
.br 
Solve a linear system of the form Ax = b, where A and b are the last 
two elements on the stack. A must be a square matrix and b must 
be a matrix with one column. This function does not compute inv(A), 
but obtains the solution by a more efficient LU decomposition method.

especially when solving linear systems with relatively large dimension or 
with poorly conditioned matrices.

function_sub 
.br 
Subtract element 1 from element 2.

.TP
.B *
function_var_unbiased 
.br 
Compute the unbiased sample variance of each of the columns of a real NxM 
matrix, returning a 1xM matrix as a result. (Compare to HP48\&'s var 
function.) 
.TP
.B *
function_var_biased 
.br 
Compute the biased (population) sample variance of each of the columns of a 
real NxM matrix, returning a 1xM matrix as a result. (Compare to HP48\&'s 
pvar function.) 
.PP

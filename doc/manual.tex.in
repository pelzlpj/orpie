\section{Introduction}
Orpie is a console-based RPN (reverse polish notation) desktop
calculator.  The interface is similar to that of modern
Hewlett-Packard${}^{TM}$ calculators, but has been optimized for efficiency on
a PC keyboard.  The design is also influenced to some degree by the 
%BEGIN LATEX
Mutt email client\footnote{http://www.mutt.org} 
%END LATEX
%HEVEA \begin{rawhtml} <a href="http://www.mutt.org">Mutt email client</a> \end{rawhtml}
and the 
%BEGIN LATEX
Vim editor\footnote{http://vim.sf.net}.
%END LATEX
%HEVEA \begin{rawhtml} <a href="http://vim.sf.net">Vim editor</a>. \end{rawhtml} 

Orpie does not have graphing capability, nor does it offer much in the way of a
programming interface; other applications such as 
%BEGIN LATEX
GNU Octave\footnote{http://www.octave.org} 
%END LATEX
%HEVEA \begin{rawhtml} <a href="http://www.octave.org">GNU Octave</a>. \end{rawhtml} 
are already very effective for such tasks.  Orpie focuses specifically on
helping you to crunch numbers quickly.

Orpie is written in 
%BEGIN LATEX
Objective Caml (aka OCaml)\footnote{http://caml.inria.fr/},
%END LATEX
%HEVEA \begin{rawhtml} <a href="http://caml.inria.fr">Objective Caml</a> (aka OCaml), \end{rawhtml} 
a high-performance functional programming language with a whole lot of nice
features.  I highly recommend it.

\section{Installation}
This section describes how to install Orpie by compiling from source.  Volunteers have
pre-packaged Orpie for several popular operating systems, so you may be able to save
yourself some time by installing from those packages.  Please check the Orpie website for
up-to-date package information.

Before installing Orpie, you should have installed the 
%BEGIN LATEX
GNU Scientific Library (GSL)\footnote{http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/} 
%END LATEX
%HEVEA \begin{rawhtml} <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/gsl/">GNU Scientific Library</a> (GSL) \end{rawhtml} 
version 1.4 or greater.  You will also need a curses library (e.g.
%BEGIN LATEX
ncurses\footnote{http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html}), 
%END LATEX
%HEVEA \begin{rawhtml} <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/ncurses.html">ncurses</a>), \end{rawhtml} 
which is almost certainly already installed on your system.  Finally, OCaml
3.07 or higher is required to compile the sources.  You will need the Nums
library that is distributed with OCaml; if you install OCaml from binary packages
distributed by your OS vendor, you may find that separate Nums packages must also be
installed.

I will assume you have received this program in the form of a source tarball, 
e.g. ``\texttt{orpie-x.x.tar.gz}''.  You have undoubtedly extracted this archive 
already (e.g. using ``\texttt{tar xvzf orpie-x.x.tar.gz}'').  Enter the root of 
the Orpie installation directory, e.g. ``\texttt{cd orpie-x.x}''.  You can compile
the sources with the following sequence:
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./configure
$ make
\end{verbatim}
Finally, run ``\texttt{make install}'' (as root) to install the executables.
``\texttt{configure}'' accepts a number of parameters that you can learn about with
``\texttt{./configure --help}''.  Perhaps the most common of these is the {\tt
--prefix} option, which lets you install to a non-standard
directory\footnote{The default installation prefix is \texttt{/usr/local}.  The \texttt{orpierc} file
will be placed in \texttt{\$(prefix)/etc} by default; use the \texttt{--sysconfdir} option to 
choose a different location.}.

CAUTION: while this manpage should be suitable as a quick reference, it may
be subject to miscellaneous shortcomings in typesetting.  The definitive 
documentation is the user manual provided with Orpie in PDF format.

%@% END-IF %@%
This section describes how to use Orpie in its default configuration.  After
familiarizing yourself with the basic operations as outlined in this section,
you may wish to consult 
%@% IF LATEX %@%
Section \ref{advanced} 
%@% ELSE %@%
the \Cmd{orpierc}{5} manpage
%@% END-IF %@%
to see how Orpie can be configured to better fit your needs.

\subsection{Overview}
%@% IF LATEX %@%
You can start the calculator by executing \texttt{orpie}.
%@% END-IF %@%
The interface has two
panels.  The left panel combines status information with context-sensitive help;
the right panel represents the calculator's stack.  (Note that the left panel
will be hidden if Orpie is run in a terminal with less than 80 columns.)

In general, you perform calculations by first entering data on to the stack,
then executing functions that operate on the stack data.  As an example, you can
hit \texttt{1<enter>2<enter>+} in order to add 1 and 2.

%@% IF LATEX %@%
\subsection{Entering Data}
\subsubsection{Entering Real Numbers}
%@% ELSE %@%
\subsection{Entering Real Numbers}
%@% END-IF %@%
To enter a real number, just type the desired digits and hit enter.  The space
bar will begin entry of a scientific notation exponent.  The '\texttt{n}' key is used
for negation.  Here are some examples:
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\begin{center}
   \begin{tabular}[t]{|r|r|}
%@% ELSE %@%
\begin{Table}{2}
%@% END-IF %@%

%@% IF LATEX %@%
\subsubsection{Entering Complex Numbers}
%@% ELSE %@%
\subsection{Entering Complex Numbers}
%@% END-IF %@%
Orpie can represent complex numbers using either cartesian (rectangular) or
polar coordinates.  See 
%@% IF LATEX %@%
Section \ref{rectpolar} 
%@% ELSE %@%
PERFORMING BASIC COMMAND OPERATIONS
%@% END-IF %@%
to see how to change the complex number display mode.

A complex number is entered by first pressing '\texttt{(}', then entering the real
part, then pressing '\texttt{,}' followed by the imaginary part.  Alternatively, you
can press '\texttt{(}' followed by the magnitude, then '\texttt{<}' followed by the
phase angle.  The angle will be interpreted in degrees or radians, depending on
the current setting of the angle mode 
%@% IF LATEX %@%
(see Section \ref{anglemode}).
%@% ELSE %@%
(see PERFORMING BASIC COMMAND OPERATIONS).
%@% END-IF %@%
Examples:

\subsubsection{Entering Matrices}
%@% ELSE %@%
\subsection{Entering Matrices}
%@% END-IF %@%
You can enter matrices by pressing '\texttt{[}'.  The elements of the matrix may then be
entered as described in the previous sections, and should be separated using
'\texttt{,}'.  To start a new row of the matrix, press '\texttt{[}' again.  On the
stack, each row of the matrix is enclosed in a set of brackets; for example, the
matrix
%@% IF LATEX %@%
%BEGIN LATEX
\begin{displaymath}
   \left[
   \begin{matrix}
      1 & 2 \\
      3 & 4
   \end{matrix}
   \right]
\end{displaymath}
%END LATEX
%HEVEA \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|cc|}1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{tabular}\end{center}
%@% ELSE %@%
\begin{Table}{2}
   1 & 2 \\
   3 & 4
\end{Table}
%@% END-IF %@%
would appear on the stack as \texttt{[[1, 2][3, 4]]}.

Examples of matrix entry:
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\begin{center}
   \begin{tabular}[t]{|r|r|}
%@% ELSE %@%

%@% END-IF %@%

%@% IF LATEX %@%
\subsubsection{Entering Data With Units}
%@% ELSE %@%
\subsection{Entering Data With Units}
%@% END-IF %@%
Real and complex scalars and matrices can optionally be labeled with units.  After typing
in the numeric portion of the data, press '\texttt{\_}' followed by a units string.  The format
of units strings is described in
%@% IF LATEX %@%
Section \ref{unitsformat}.
%@% ELSE %@%
the UNITS FORMATTING section.
%@% END-IF %@%

Examples of entering dimensioned data:

%@% END-IF %@%

%@% IF LATEX %@%
\subsubsection{Entering Exact Integers}
%@% ELSE %@%
\subsection{Entering Exact Integers}
%@% END-IF %@%
An exact integer may be entered by pressing '\texttt{\#}' followed by the desired
digits.  The base of the integer will be assumed to be the same as the current
calculator base mode (see 
%@% IF LATEX %@%
Section \ref{basemode} 
%@% ELSE %@%
PERFORMING BASIC COMMAND OPERATIONS
%@% END-IF %@%
to see how to set this mode).
Alternatively, the desired base may be specified by pressing space and appending
one of \{\texttt{b, o, d, h}\}, to represent binary, octal, decimal, or hexadecimal,
respectively.  On the stack, the representation of the integer will be changed
to match the current base mode.  Examples:
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\begin{center}
   \begin{tabular}[t]{|r|r|}
%@% ELSE %@%
\begin{Table}{2}
%@% END-IF %@%
      \hline 
      Keypresses & Resulting Entry \\
      \hline
%@% IF LATEX %@% 
      \texttt{\#123456<enter>} & \texttt{\# 123456\`{}d} \\
      \texttt{\#ffff<space>h<enter>} & \texttt{\# 65535\`{}d} \\
      \texttt{\#10101n<space>b<enter>} & \texttt{\# -21\`{}d} \\
%@% ELSE %@%
      \texttt{\#123456<enter>} & \texttt{\# 123456`d} \\
      \texttt{\#ffff<space>h<enter>} & \texttt{\# 65535`d} \\
      \texttt{\#10101n<space>b<enter>} & \texttt{\# -21`d} \\
%@% END-IF %@%
      \hline
%@% IF LATEX %@%
   \end{tabular}
\end{center}
%@% ELSE %@%
\end{Table}
%@% END-IF %@%

Note that exact integers may have unlimited length, and the basic arithmetic
operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) will be performed
using exact arithmetic when both arguments are integers.

%@% IF LATEX %@%
\subsubsection{Entering Variable Names}
%@% ELSE %@%
\subsection{Entering Variable Names}
%@% END-IF %@%
A variable name may be entered by pressing '\texttt{@}' followed by the desired
variable name string.  The string may contain alphanumeric characters, dashes, and
underscores.  Example:
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\begin{center}
   \begin{tabular}[t]{|r|r|}
%@% ELSE %@%
\begin{Table}{2}
%@% END-IF %@%
      \hline 
      Keypresses & Resulting Entry \\
      \hline
      \texttt{@myvar} & \texttt{@ myvar}\\
      \hline
%@% IF LATEX %@%
   \end{tabular}
\end{center}
%@% ELSE %@%
\end{Table}
%@% END-IF %@%
Orpie also supports autocompletion of variable names.  The help panel displays a
list of pre-existing variables that partially match the name currently being entered.
You can press '\texttt{<tab>}' to iterate through the list of matching variables.

As a shortcut, keys \texttt{<f1>-<f4>} will enter the variables (``registers'') 
\texttt{@ r01} through \texttt{@ r04}.

%@% IF LATEX %@%
\subsubsection{Entering Physical Constants}
%@% ELSE %@%
\subsection{Entering Physical Constants}
%@% END-IF %@%
Orpie includes definitions for a number of fundamental physical constants.  To
enter a constant, press '\texttt{C}', followed by the first few letters/digits
of the constant's symbol, then hit enter.  Orpie offers an autocompletion
feature for physical constants, so you only need to type enough of the constant
to identify it uniquely.  A list of matching constants will appear in the left
panel of the display, to assist you in finding the desired choice.

The following is a list of Orpie's physical constant symbols:
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\begin{center}
   \begin{tabular}[t]{|r|l|}

      \texttt{Vm}    & molar volume \\
      \texttt{R}     & universal gas constant \\
      \texttt{stdT}  & standard temperature \\
      \texttt{stdP}  & standard pressure \\

\subsubsection{Entering Data With an External Editor}
\label{editor}
%@% ELSE %@%
\subsection{Entering Data With an External Editor}
%@% END-IF %@%
Orpie can also parse input entered via an external editor.  You may find this to be
a convenient method for entering large matrices.  Pressing '\texttt{E}' will
launch the external editor, and the various data types may be entered as illustrated
by the examples below:
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\begin{center}
   \begin{tabular}[t]{|r|l|}
%@% ELSE %@%
\begin{Table}{2}
%@% END-IF %@%
      \hline 
      Data Type & Sample Input String \\
      \hline
%@% IF LATEX %@%
      exact integer & \texttt{\#12345678\`{}d}, where the trailing
                         letter is one of the base characters \{b, o, d, h\} \\
%@% ELSE %@%
      exact integer & \texttt{\#12345678`d}, where the trailing
                         letter is one of the base characters \{b, o, d, h\} \\
%@% END-IF %@%
      real number      & \texttt{-123.45e67} \\
      complex number   & \texttt{(1e10, 2)} or \texttt{(1 <90)} \\
      real matrix      & \texttt{[[1, 2][3.1, 4.5e10]]} \\
      complex matrix   & \texttt{[[(1, 0), 5][1e10, (2 <90)]]} \\
      variable         & \texttt{@myvar} \\
      \hline
%@% IF LATEX %@%
   \end{tabular}
\end{center}
%@% ELSE %@%
\end{Table}
%@% END-IF %@%
Real and complex numbers and matrices may have units appended; just add a units
string such as ``\texttt{\_N*m/s}'' immediately following the numeric portion
of the expression.

Notice that the complex matrix input parser is quite flexible; real and complex
matrix elements may be mixed, and cartesian and polar complex formats may be
mixed as well.

Multiple stack entries may be specified in the same file, if they are separated
by whitespace.  For example, entering \texttt{(1, 2) 1.5} into the editor will cause
the complex value \texttt{(1, 2)} to be placed on the stack, followed by the real
value \texttt{1.5}.

The input parser will discard whitespace where possible, so feel free to add
any form of whitespace between matrix rows, matrix elements, real and complex
components, etc.  

\subsection{Executing Basic Function Operations}
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\label{functionops}
%@% END-IF %@%
Once some data has been entered on the stack, you can apply operations to that
data.  For example, '\texttt{+}' will add the last two elements on the stack.  By
default, the following keys have been bound to such operations:
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\begin{center}
   \begin{tabular}[t]{|r|l|}
%@% ELSE %@%
\begin{Table}{2}
%@% END-IF %@%
      \hline 
      Keys & Operations \\
      \hline
      \texttt{+} & add last two stack elements \\
      \texttt{-} & subtract element 1 from element 2 \\
      \texttt{*} & multiply last two stack elements \\
      \texttt{/} & divide element 2 by element 1 \\
      %@% IF LATEX %@%
      \texttt{\^{}} & raise element 2 to the power of element 1 \\
      %@% ELSE %@%
      \texttt{\Circum} & raise element 2 to the power of element 1 \\
      %@% END-IF %@%
      \texttt{n} & negate last element \\
      \texttt{i} & invert last element \\
      \texttt{s} & square root function \\
      \texttt{a} & absolute value function \\
      \texttt{e} & exponential function \\
      \texttt{l} & natural logarithm function \\
      \texttt{c} & complex conjugate function \\
      \texttt{!} & factorial function  \\
      \texttt{\%} & element 2 mod element 1 \\
      \texttt{S} & store element 2 in (variable) element 1 \\
      \texttt{;} & evaluate variable to obtain contents \\
      \hline
%@% IF LATEX %@%
   \end{tabular}
\end{center}
%@% ELSE %@%
\end{Table}
%@% END-IF %@%

As a shortcut, function operators will automatically enter any data that you
were in the process of entering.  So instead of the sequence 
\texttt{2<enter>2<enter>+}, you could type simply \texttt{2<enter>2+} and the second number
would be entered before the addition operation is applied.

As an additional shortcut, any variable names used as function arguments will
be evaluated before application of the function.  In other words, it is not necessary
to evaluate variables before performing arithmetic operations on them.

\subsection{Executing Function Abbreviations}
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\label{abbrevfunctions}
%@% END-IF %@%
One could bind nearly all calculator operations to specific keypresses, but this
would rapidly get confusing since the PC keyboard is not labeled as nicely as a
calculator keyboard is.  For this reason, Orpie includes an 
\emph{abbreviation} syntax.

To activate an abbreviation, press '\texttt{'}' (quote key), followed by the
first few letters/digits of the abbreviation, then hit enter.  Orpie offers an
autocompletion feature for abbreviations, so you only need to type enough of
the operation to identify it uniquely.  The matching abbreviations will appear
in the left panel of the display, to assist you in finding the appropriate
operation.

To avoid interface conflicts, abbreviations may be entered only when the
entry buffer (the bottom line of the screen) is empty.

The following functions are available as abbreviations:
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\begin{center}
   \begin{tabular}[t]{|l|l|}
%@% ELSE %@%
\begin{Table}{2}

      \hline 
      Abbreviations & Functions \\
      \hline
      \texttt{inv} & inverse function \\
      \texttt{pow} & raise element 2 to the power of element 1 \\

Entering abbreviations can become tedious when performing repetitive calculations.
To save some keystrokes, Orpie will automatically bind recently-used operations with no prexisting
binding to keys \texttt{<f5>-<f12>}.  The current autobindings can be viewed by pressing \texttt{'h'}
to cycle between the various pages of the help panel.

%@% IF LATEX %@%
Section \ref{abbrevfunctions}, 
%@% ELSE %@%
the section EXECUTING FUNCTION ABBREVIATIONS,
%@% END-IF %@%
there are a large number of calculator commands that

%@% END-IF %@%

\subsection{Browsing the Stack}
Orpie offers a \emph{stack browsing mode} to assist in viewing and manipulating
stack data.  Press \texttt{<up>} to enter stack browsing mode; this should
highlight the last stack element.  You can use the up and down arrow keys to
select different stack elements.  The following keys are useful in stack
browsing mode:
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\begin{center}
   \begin{tabular}[t]{|r|l|}
%@% ELSE %@%
\begin{Table}{2}
%@% END-IF %@%
      \hline 
      Keys & Operations \\
      \hline
      \texttt{q} & quit stack browsing mode \\
      \texttt{<left>} & scroll selected entry to the left \\
      \texttt{<right>} & scroll selected entry to the right \\
      \texttt{r} & cyclically ``roll'' stack elements downward, below the selected element (inclusive) \\
      \texttt{R} & cyclically ``roll'' stack elements upward, below the selected element (inclusive) \\
      \texttt{v} & view the currently selected element in a fullscreen editor \\
      \texttt{E} & edit the currently selected element with an external editor \\
      \texttt{<enter>} & duplicate the currently selected element \\
      \hline
%@% IF LATEX %@%
   \end{tabular}
\end{center}
%@% ELSE %@%
\end{Table}
%@% END-IF %@%

The left and right scrolling option may prove useful for viewing very lengthy
stack entries, such as large matrices.  The edit option provides a convenient
way to correct data after it has been entered on the stack.

\subsection{Units Formatting}
A units string is a list of units separated by '\texttt{*}' to indicate multiplication
and '\texttt{/}' to indicate division.  Units may be raised to real-valued powers
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\label{unitsformat}
using the '\texttt{\^{}}' character.  A contrived example of a valid unit string would be 
"\texttt{N*nm\^{}2*kg/s/in\^{}-3*GHz\^{}2.34}".
%@% ELSE %@%
using the '\texttt{\Circum}' character.  A contrived example of a valid unit string would be 
"\texttt{N*nm\Circum2*kg/s/in\Circum-3*GHz\Circum2.34}".
%@% END-IF %@%

Orpie supports the standard SI prefix set, 
\texttt{\{y, z, a, f, p, n, u, m, c, d, da, h, k, M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y\}}
(note the use of '\texttt{u}' for micro-).  These prefixes may be applied
to any of the following exhaustive sets of units:

Orpie reads a run-configuration textfile (generally \texttt{/etc/orpierc} or
\texttt{/usr/local/etc/orpierc}) to determine key and command bindings.  You can
create a personalized configuration file in \texttt{\$HOME/.orpierc}, and select
bindings that match your usage patterns.  The recommended procedure is to ``include''
the \texttt{orpierc} file provided with Orpie 
%@% IF LATEX %@%

the configuration file for the Mutt email client (muttrc).

Within the \texttt{orpierc} file, strings should be enclosed in double quotes (\texttt{"}).
A double quote character inside a string may be represented by 
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\texttt{$\backslash$"} .
%@% ELSE %@%
\Bs " .
%@% END-IF %@%
The backslash character must be represented by doubling it

Several configuration variables can be set using this syntax; check
%@% IF LATEX %@%
Section \ref{variables}
%@% ELSE %@%
the CONFIGURATION VARIABLES description
%@% END-IF %@%
to see a list.  The variables are unquoted, but the values should be quoted strings.

\subsection{Creating Key Bindings}

This command will bind a keypress to execute a calculator operation.  
The various operations, which should not be enclosed in quotes,
may be found in 
%@% IF LATEX %@%
Section \ref{operationslist}. 
%@% ELSE %@%
the section on CALCULATOR OPERATIONS.
%@% END-IF %@%
Key identifiers may be specified by strings that represent a single keypress,
for example \texttt{"m"} (quotes included).  The key may be prefixed with 
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\texttt{"$\backslash\backslash$C"} or \texttt{"$\backslash\backslash$M"} 
%@% ELSE %@%
"\Bs\Bs C" or "\Bs\Bs M"
%@% END-IF %@%
to represent Control or Meta (Alt) modifiers, respectively; note that the
backslash must be doubled.  A number of special keys lack single-character
representations, so the following strings may be used to represent them:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \texttt{"<esc>"}
   \item \texttt{"<tab>"}
   \item \texttt{"<enter>"}
   \item \texttt{"<return>"}
   \item \texttt{"<insert>"}
   \item \texttt{"<home>"}
   \item \texttt{"<end>"}
   \item \texttt{"<pageup>"}
   \item \texttt{"<pagedown>"}
   \item \texttt{"<space>"}
   \item \texttt{"<left>"}
   \item \texttt{"<right>"}
   \item \texttt{"<up>"}
   \item \texttt{"<down>"}
   \item \texttt{"<f1>"} to \texttt{"<f12>"}
\end{itemize}
Due to differences between various terminal emulators, this key identifier syntax may
not be adequate to describe every keypress.  As a workaround, Orpie will also accept key
identifiers in octal notation.  As an example, you could use 
%@% IF LATEX %@%
\texttt{$\backslash$024} 
%@% ELSE %@%
\Bs 024
%@% END-IF %@%
(do \emph{not} enclose it in quotes) to represent Ctrl-T.

Orpie includes a secondary executable, \texttt{orpie-curses-keys}, that prints out
the key identifiers associated with keypresses.  You may find it useful when customizing
\texttt{orpierc}.

Multiple keys may be bound to the same operation, if desired.

These commands will remove key bindings associated with the various entry

Syntax: \texttt{autobind \emph{key\_identifier}} \\ \\
In order to make repetitive calculations more pleasant, Orpie offers an automatic key
binding feature.  When a function or command is executed using its abbreviation, 
one of the keys selected by the \texttt{autobind} syntax will be 
automatically bound to that operation (unless the operation has already been bound 
to a key).  The current set of autobindings can be viewed in the help panel by executing
\texttt{command\_cycle\_help} (bound to \texttt{'h'} by default).

The syntax for the key identifiers is provided in the previous section.

The operation abbreviations should be quoted strings, for example \texttt{"sin"}

Orpie performs autocompletion on these abbreviations, allowing you to type
usually just a few letters in order to select the desired command.  The order of the
autocompletion matches will be the same as the order in which the abbreviations are
registered by the rcfile--so you may wish to place the more commonly used operation
abbreviations earlier in the list.

Multiple abbreviations may be bound to the same operation, if desired.

The macro string should be a list of whitespace-separated keypresses, e.g.
\texttt{"2 <return> 2 +"} (including quotes).

This macro syntax provides a way to create small programs; by way of example,
the default orpierc file includes macros for the base 2 logarithm and the
binary entropy function (bound to \texttt{L} and \texttt{H}, respectively),
as well as ``register'' variable shortcuts (\texttt{<f1>} to \texttt{<f12>}).

Macros may call other macros recursively.  However, take care that a macro does
not call \emph{itself} recursively; Orpie will not trap the infinite loop.

Note that operation abbreviations may be accessed within macros.  For example,
\texttt{macro "A" "' a b o u t <return>"} would bind \texttt{A} to display
the ``about Orpie'' screen.

      horizontal scrolling in place of word wrapping, so that the columns of large 
      matrices can be properly aligned.  (The Vim editor could be used in this fashion
      by setting \texttt{editor} to \texttt{"vim -c 'set nowrap'"}.)
   \item \texttt{hide\_help} \\

      Set this variable to \texttt{"true"} to minimize memory usage, or leave it on
      the default of \texttt{"false"} to improve rendering performance.  (By default,
      Orpie caches multiple string representations of all stack elements.  Very large

The following operations are functions--that is, they will consume at least one
argument from the stack.  Orpie will generally abort the computation and
provide an informative error message if a function cannot be successfully applied (for
example, if you try to compute the transpose of something that is not a matrix).

For the exact integer data type, basic arithmetic operations will yield an exact
integer result.  Division of two exact integers will yield the quotient of
the division.  The more complicated functions will generally promote the integer
to a real number, and as such the arithmetic will no longer be exact.
\begin{itemize}
   \item \texttt{function\_10\_x} \\
      Raise 10 to the power of the last stack element (inverse of function\_log10).
   \item \texttt{function\_abs} \\
      Compute the absolute value of the last stack element.
   \item \texttt{function\_acos} \\
      Compute the inverse cosine of the last stack element.  For real numbers,
      The result will be provided either in degrees or radians, depending on
      the angle mode of the calculator.
   \item \texttt{function\_acosh} \\
      Compute the inverse hyperbolic cosine of the last stack element.
   \item \texttt{function\_add} \\
      Add last two stack elements.
   \item \texttt{function\_arg} \\
      Compute the argument (phase angle of complex number) of the last stack
      element.  The value will be provided in either degrees or radians,
      depending on the current angle mode of the calculator.
   \item \texttt{function\_asin} \\
      Compute the inverse sine of the last stack element.  For real numbers,
      The result will be provided either in degrees or radians, depending on
      the angle mode of the calculator.
   \item \texttt{function\_asinh} \\
      Compute the inverse hyperbolic sine of the last stack element.
   \item \texttt{function\_atan} \\
      Compute the inverse tangent of the last stack element.  For real numbers,
      The result will be provided either in degrees or radians, depending on
      the angle mode of the calculator.
   \item \texttt{function\_atanh} \\
      Compute the inverse hyperbolic tangent of the last stack element.
   \item \texttt{function\_binomial\_coeff} \\
      Compute the binomial coefficient (``n choose k'') formed by the last two
      stack elements.  If these arguments are real, the coefficient is computed
      using a fast approximation to the log of the gamma function, and therefore
      the result is subject to rounding errors.  For exact integer arguments,
      the coefficient is computed using exact arithmetic; this has the potential
      to be a slow operation.
   \item \texttt{function\_ceiling} \\
      Compute the ceiling of the last stack element.
   \item \texttt{function\_convert\_units} \\
      Convert stack element 2 to an equivalent expression in the units of
      element 1.  Element 1 should be real-valued, and its magnitude will
      be ignored when computing the conversion.
   \item \texttt{function\_cos} \\
      Compute the cosine of the last stack element.  If the argument is real,
      it will be assumed to be either degrees or radians, depending on the
      angle mode of the calculator.
   \item \texttt{function\_cosh} \\
      Compute the hyperbolic cosine of the last stack element.
   \item \texttt{function\_conj} \\
      Compute the complex conjugate of the last stack element.
   \item \texttt{function\_div} \\
      Divide element 2 by element 1.
   \item \texttt{function\_erf} \\
      Compute the error function of the last stack element.
   \item \texttt{function\_erfc} \\
      Compute the complementary error function of the last stack element.
   \item \texttt{function\_eval} \\
      Obtain the contents of the variable in the last stack position.
   \item \texttt{function\_exp} \\
      Evaluate the exponential function of the last stack element.
   \item \texttt{function\_factorial} \\
      Compute the factorial of the last stack element.  For a real argument,
      this is computed using a fast approximation to the gamma function,
      and therefore the result may be subject to rounding errors (or overflow).  For an 
      exact integer argument, the factorial is computed using exact arithmetic; 
      this has the potential to be a slow operation.
   \item \texttt{function\_floor} \\
      Compute the floor of the last stack element.
   \item \texttt{function\_gamma} \\
      Compute the Euler gamma function of the last stack element.

   \item \texttt{function\_inv} \\
      Compute the multiplicative inverse of the last stack element.

      operation may be applied only to integer type data.
   \item \texttt{function\_ln} \\
      Compute the natural logarithm of the last stack element.
   \item \texttt{function\_lngamma} \\
      Compute the natural logarithm of the Euler gamma function of the last
      stack element.
   \item \texttt{function\_log10} \\
      Compute the base-10 logarithm of the last stack element.
   \item \texttt{function\_maximum} \\
      Find the maximum values of each of the columns of a real NxM matrix,
      returning a 1xM matrix as a result.
   \item \texttt{function\_minimum} \\
      Find the minimum values of each of the columns of a real NxM matrix,
      returning a 1xM matrix as a result.
   \item \texttt{function\_mean} \\
      Compute the sample means of each of the columns of a real NxM matrix,
      returning a 1xM matrix as a result.
   \item \texttt{function\_mod} \\
      Compute element 2 mod element 1.  This operation can be applied only
      to integer type data.
   \item \texttt{function\_mult} \\
      Multiply last two stack elements.
   \item \texttt{function\_neg} \\
      Negate last stack element.
   \item \texttt{function\_permutation} \\
      Compute the permutation coefficient determined by the last two stack
      elements 'n' and 'k': the number of ways of obtaining an ordered subset
      of k elements from a set of n elements.
      If these arguments are real, the coefficient is computed
      using a fast approximation to the log of the gamma function, and therefore
      the result is subject to rounding errors.  For exact integer arguments,
      the coefficient is computed using exact arithmetic; this has the potential
      to be a slow operation.
   \item \texttt{function\_pow} \\
      Raise element 2 to the power of element 1.
   \item \texttt{function\_purge} \\
      Delete the variable in the last stack position.
   \item \texttt{function\_re} \\
      Compute the real part of the last stack element.
   \item \texttt{function\_sin} \\
      Compute the sine of the last stack element.  If the argument is real, it
      will be assumed to be either degrees or radians, depending on the angle
      mode of the calculator.
   \item \texttt{function\_sinh} \\
      Compute the hyperbolic sine of the last stack element.
   \item \texttt{function\_solve\_linear} \\
      Solve a linear system of the form Ax = b, where A and b are the last
      two elements on the stack.  A must be a square matrix and b must
      be a matrix with one column.  This function does not compute inv(A),
      but obtains the solution by a more efficient LU decomposition method.
      This function is recommended over explicitly computing the inverse,
      especially when solving linear systems with relatively large dimension or
      with poorly conditioned matrices.
   \item \texttt{function\_sq} \\
      Square the last stack element.
   \item \texttt{function\_sqrt} \\
      Compute the square root of the last stack element.

   \item \texttt{function\_stdev\_unbiased} \\
      Compute the unbiased sample standard deviation of each of the columns of a real NxM
      matrix, returning a 1xM matrix as a result.  (Compare to HP48's \texttt{sdev}
      function.)
   \item \texttt{function\_stdev\_biased} \\
      Compute the biased (population) sample standard deviation of each of the columns 
      of a real NxM matrix, returning a 1xM matrix as a result.  (Compare to 
      HP48's \texttt{psdev} function.)
   \item \texttt{function\_store} \\
      Store element 2 in (variable) element 1.
   \item \texttt{function\_sub} \\
      Subtract element 1 from element 2.
   \item \texttt{function\_sumsq} \\

      1xM matrix as a result.
   \item \texttt{function\_tan} \\
      Compute the tangent of the last stack element.  If the argument is real,
      it will be assumed to be either degrees or radians, depending on the
      angle mode of the calculator.
   \item \texttt{function\_tanh} \\
      Compute the hyperbolic tangent of the last stack element.
   \item \texttt{function\_to\_int} \\
      Convert a real number to an integer type.
   \item \texttt{function\_to\_real} \\
      Convert an integer type to a real number.

\section{(Not So) Frequently Asked Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
   \item {\bf Whatever happened to \texttt{rpc}?}

      rpc, of course, would be the predecessor to Orpie.  It was written
      in C++.

      Over the years I have grown increasingly disenchanted with C++, and
      as a result I lost interest in maintaining rpc.  When I settled on OCaml
      as a replacement language, I began working on Orpie as a way to improve
      my OCaml abilities.

   \item {\bf What's wrong with C++?  And what's this OCaml thing?}

      \texttt{<rant>} \\
      C++ has had so many misfeatures bolted on that no one can possibly hold
      the entire syntax in his head at one time.  The syntax is not only
      prohibitively vast, but also horribly ugly--especially when dealing 
      with templates.  The ability to use pointers presents many opportunities 
      to shoot oneself in the foot.  Garbage collection and exceptions exist 
      as afterthoughts.  In short, there are few compelling reasons to consider 
      C++ for any project that does not require low-level hardware access. \\
      \texttt{</rant>} 
     
      I found OCaml after searching for a Better Language that offers good
      performance.  OCaml is a functional programming language with a pretty
      syntax, clean design, and all sorts of nice features that one really
      should expect from a modern programming language.  It supports
      functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming paradigms,
      so it is well-suited to a broad class of programming tasks.
      The type-checking compiler is exceedingly strict, and I find that this
      improves my overall productivity by catching a lot of bugs prior to
      runtime.  OCaml also interfaces with C quite easily, and there are
      bindings available for many commonly used libraries.

   \item {\bf Does Orpie include any enhancements over the old \texttt{rpc}?}

      The biggest usability enhancement would be the rcfile for keybindings.
      The context-sensitive help panel is new, as is user-defined variable
      support, units handling, and autobindings.  Integer data may be
      entered and manipulated with arbitrary precision (thanks to the Nums 
      library that ships with OCaml).  The error messages provided by
      Orpie are, on average, more informative than those provided by rpc;
      this is a direct consequence of OCaml's excellent exception handling
      support.

      I also believe that Orpie has fewer bugs in the input handler/parser,
      but this remains to be seen.

   \item {\bf When I use \{+, -, *, /\} on the numeric keypad under gnome-terminal,
      Orpie reads some letters instead of the expected symbols.  Can I do anything about this?}

      I was able to fix the problem by executing
      \begin{verbatim}
      $ export TERM=linux
      \end{verbatim}
      before launching Orpie.  gnome-terminal sets \texttt{\$TERM} to \texttt{xterm}, but
      apparently does not behave like a real xterm with respect to the numeric keypad.

   \item {\bf Orpie crashes with a segmentation fault on startup.  What can I do?}

      Try deleting the calculator state file (probably \texttt{\~{}/.orpie/calc\_state} ,
      unless you changed the \texttt{data\_dir} configuration variable).  Orpie makes use of 
      OCaml's marshalling feature, which is very convenient but doesn't respond well to corrupt
      data files.

Orpie uses tla's ``configs'' support.  After getting a copy of the source, run \\
\texttt{"tla build-config dist.arch"} in the project tree root to grab the 
extra packages that Orpie depends on.

At the moment, I would really appreciate help writing additional test cases for
the calculator object.  It's not terribly difficult, just time-consuming.  If you're
interested in lending a hand, have a look at the source in \texttt{calc\_test.ml} and
use \texttt{"make test.opt"} to build the testing executable.

Do you feel compelled to compensate me for writing Orpie?  As a \emph{poor, starving}
